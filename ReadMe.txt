We Will be creating an Employee Directory Application which will store basic data such as-
	-NAME
	-LOCATION
	-PHOTO
	-HOBBIES
	-CONTACT

for this application deployment we will use AWS services that are-
	-Amazon S3 (storage)
	-AWS IAM (security)
	-Amazon Cloudwatch 
	-Amazon DynamoDB (DBMS)
	-Amazon EC2 Instance (Compute)
	-Amazon RDS DB Instance (DBMS)

we will be deploying all this services using the GUI not the CLI so follow the steps
in the UpGiven Files.
