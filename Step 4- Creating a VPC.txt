In this Step, you will create a new VPC.

1) If needed, log in to the AWS Management Console as your Admin user.

2) In the Services search box, enter VPC and open the VPC console by choosing VPC from the list.

3) In the navigation pane, under Virtual private cloud, choose Your VPCs.

4) Choose Create VPC.

5)Configure these settings:
	-Name tag: app-vpc
	-IPv4 CIDR block: 10.1.0.0/16
6) Choose Create VPC.

7) In the navigation pane, under Virtual private cloud, choose Internet gateways

8) Choose Create internet gateway.

9) For Name tag, paste app-igw and choose Create internet gateway.

10) In the details page for the internet gateway, choose Actions and then choose Attach to VPC.

11) For Available VPCs, choose app-vpc and then choose Attach internet gateway.


For the next Step, you will create the four subnets for your VPC. You will configure the two public subnets first, and then configure the two private subnets.

1) From the navigation pane, choose Subnets.

2) Choose Create subnet.

3) For the first public subnet, configure these settings:
	-VPC ID: app-vpc
	-Subnet name:Public Subnet 1
	-Availability Zone: Choose the first Availability Zone
	-Example: If you are in US West (Oregon), you would choose us-west-2a
	-IPv4 CIDR block: 10.1.1.0/24
4) Choose Add new subnet.

5) For the second public subnet, configure these settings:
	-Subnet name: Public Subnet 2
	-Availability Zone: Choose the second Availability Zone
	Example: If you are in US West (Oregon), you would choose us-west-2b
	-IPv4 CIDR block: 10.1.2.0/24

6) Choose Add new subnet and for the first private subnet, configure these settings:
	-Subnet name: Private Subnet 1
	-Availability Zone: Choose the first Availability Zone
	Example: If you are in US West (Oregon), you would choose us-west-2a
	-IPv4 CIDR block: 10.1.3.0/24.

7) Choose Add new subnet and for the second private subnet, configure the following:
	-Subnet name: Private Subnet 2
	-Availability Zone: Choose the second Availability Zone
	Example: If you are in US West (Oregon), you would choose us-west-2b
	-IPv4 CIDR block: 10.1.4.0/24
8) Finally, choose Create subnet.

9) After the subnets are created, select the check box for Public Subnet 1.

10) Choose Actions and then choose Edit subnet settings.

11) For Auto-assign IP settings, select Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address and then choose Save.

12) Clear the check box for Public Subnet 1 and select the check box for Public Subnet 2.

13) Again, choose Actions and then Edit subnet settings.

14) For Auto-assign IP settings, select Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address and save the settings.



For the next Step, you will create the route tables for your VPC.

1) First, you will create the public route table.

2) In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables.

3) Choose Create route table.

4) For the route table, configure these settings:
	-Name: app-routetable-public
	-VPC: app-vpc

5) Choose Create route table.
	If needed, open the route table details pane by choosing app-routetable-public from the list.

6) Choose the Routes tab and choose Edit routes.

7) Choose Add route and configure these settings:
	-Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
	-Target: Internet Gateway, then choose app-igw (which you set up in the VPC task)

8) Choose Save changes.

9) Choose the Subnet associations tab.

10) Scroll to Subnets without explicit associations and choose Edit subnet associations.

11) Select the two public subnets that you created (Public Subnet 1 and Public Subnet 2) and choose Save associations.

12) Next, you will create the private route table.

13) In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables.

14) Choose Create route table and configure these settings:
	-Name: app-routetable-private
	-VPC: app-vpc

15) Choose Create route table.
	If needed, open the details pane for app-routetable-private by choosing it from the list.

16) Choose the Subnet associations tab.

17) Scroll to Subnets without explicit associations and choose Edit subnet associations.

18) Select the two private subnets (Private Subnet 1 and Private Subnet 2) and choose Save associations.
